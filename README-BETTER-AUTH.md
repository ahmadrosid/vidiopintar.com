# Better Auth Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Better Auth in the Vidiopintar project, replacing the previous Supabase authentication system.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Supabase Dependencies**
   - Removed Supabase client and authentication code
   - Removed Supabase environment variables from Dockerfile
   - Removed Supabase authentication from login and signup pages

2. **Added Better Auth**
   - Installed Better Auth and its dependencies
   - Set up database schema for authentication (users, sessions, accounts, verification)
   - Created server-side and client-side authentication configurations
   - Implemented API routes for authentication
   - Created server actions for login and signup
   - Updated login and signup forms to use Better Auth
   - Added middleware for route protection

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set for Better Auth to work:

```
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-better-auth-secret"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="https://your-site-url.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="https://your-site-url.com"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database"
```

These have been added to the Dockerfile for production deployment, but for local development, you should create a `.env.local` file with these variables.

### Database Setup

Better Auth requires specific tables in your database. The schema has been defined in `lib/db/schema/auth.ts` and includes:

- `user` - Stores user information
- `session` - Manages user sessions
- `account` - Handles authentication providers and credentials
- `verification` - Manages email verification and password reset tokens

## Usage

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: Users can log in using email/password via the `/login` page
2. **Signup**: New users can register via the `/signup` page
3. **Logout**: Users can log out using the `LogoutButton` component
4. **Route Protection**: Protected routes are managed by the middleware

### Components

- `AuthInitializer`: Initializes the auth client and session
- `LogoutButton`: Provides a button for users to log out

### Server Actions

- `signIn`: Handles user login
- `signUp`: Handles user registration

## Future Enhancements

1. **Social Authentication**: Google authentication is prepared but commented out. To enable it:
   - Add Google OAuth credentials to environment variables
   - Uncomment the social provider configuration in `lib/auth.ts`
   - Uncomment the social login code in login and signup pages

2. **Email Verification**: Can be implemented using Better Auth's verification system

3. **Password Reset**: Can be added using Better Auth's verification tokens

## Notes

- The current implementation uses email/password authentication
- The middleware protects specified routes that require authentication
- Session management is handled by Better Auth using cookies
